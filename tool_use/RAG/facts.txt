Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
Python supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms to learn patterns from data.
Popular machine learning libraries in Python include scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
Machine learning models can be trained to make predictions on new, unseen data.

Ollama is a tool for running large language models locally on your machine.
It provides an easy way to download, install, and run various open-source language models.
Ollama supports models like Llama, Mistral, Gemma, and many others.
With Ollama, you can run AI models without needing internet connectivity.

Vector databases store embeddings and enable semantic search capabilities.
Embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning.
Vector similarity search finds documents with similar semantic content using mathematical operations.
Popular vector databases include Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate, and FAISS.

RAG combines retrieval of relevant documents with language model generation.
RAG systems first retrieve relevant context from a knowledge base.
Then they use this context to generate more accurate and informed responses.
RAG helps reduce hallucinations and provides more factual answers.

LlamaIndex is a framework for building LLM applications with your own data.
It provides tools for data ingestion, indexing, and querying.
LlamaIndex supports various vector stores and embedding models.
It can work with local models through Ollama integration.

DuckDB is an in-process SQL OLAP database management system.
It can be used as a vector store for storing and querying embeddings.
DuckDB is lightweight and doesn't require a separate server process.
It provides excellent performance for analytical workloads.
